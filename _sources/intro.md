# Ising Model as a Playground

Consider the classical 2D Ising Hamiltonian
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{H}[\{s_i\}]=-J\,\sum_{NN} s_i\,s_j- H\,\sum\,s_i
\end{eqnarray*}
for a given configuration of spins $\{s_i\}$ on an $L^2$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions and nearst neighbor (NN) interactions. We will use Monte-Carlo techniques to simulate the partition function 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{Z}=\exp\left(-\beta \sum_{\{s_i\}} \mathcal{H}[\{s_i\}]\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

In this notebook, we will examine aspects of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Then using the simulated data, test various data analysis techniques. The idea of this notebook is to tie together the physics of the Ising model, Monte Carlo simulations, and statistical analysis into one project. Below we give a rough sketch of the outline of this project.

__Overview of ideas:__
1. Exact computation of Ising model for small lattices - L = 2,3,4
    - Generation of configurations, thermodynamic functions, density of states, energy distributions
    - Computational complexity - basic algorithm scaling
    - Zeros of partition functions - complex H and complex T
2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    - Implementations: Metropolis-Hastings, Swedsen-Wang, Wolff, Heatbath, and Wang-Landau
    - Diagnostics of MCMC: equilibriation, trace plots, initial condition dependence, autocorrelation
    - Error analysis: benchmarking against exact results, effective sample size, thinning, batching, jackknife, bootstrap
    - Extensions: rewighting (multiple histogram reweightings), parallel tempering, simulated annealing
3. Statistical methodology playground:
    - PCA on raw spin configurations and on the energy-order parameter phase space (E,M)
    - Maximum likelihood, fisher information, and estimation of the temperature
    - Multiple layer perceptron for classifying phases
    - Logistic regression for $J$.
