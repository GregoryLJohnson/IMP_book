    "It will be helpful to have exact results at hand to benchmark our Monte Carlo techniques. To obtain these for small square lattices with $L = 2,3,4$, we enumerate the set of all $2^{L^2}$ spin configurations, define the partition function and other thermodynamic functions on this set, and compute corresponding thermal averages. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is additionally useful to compute the density of states in this fashion. The computation quickly becomes prohibitively costly for $L >5$. However, see this [article](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.78) on the exact density of states for square lattice nearest neighbor Ising model. See [link](https://spot.colorado.edu/%7Ebeale/MathematicaFiles/) for Mathematica notebooks which compute the exact results for a given $n \\times m$ lattice. See also this [stack exchange discussion](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/335631/ising-model-density-of-states) on enumerating the density of states for $d=1,2$."
